OK, so this is my game plan to Pass the 102 exam and I don't want to just pass it, I want to crush it.  I've taken some time away from studying from this as it kinda sucked to fail it but I have been putting it off and putting it off and I can't do it any longer!  One reoccurring theme in my life is I will start a new venture and get some proficiency and then for some reason or another, I just stop learning and growing.  It happened with learning Spanish back in like 2006.  I was in Los Angeles at the time and knowing Spanish is a great skill as it would allow me to communicate with more people.  I started kinda understanding and getting good at it and then, I just stopped studying.  Not sure why, it probably has some thing to do with a deep rooted sense that, "I am not allowed to win."  One of those stories we tell ourselves as children and it becomes apart of our psyche.  I'm no psychologist but it is a reoccurring pattern.  More recent, about a year ago, I did a woodworking project where I made dovetails on my band saw, never did it again.  Again that was a level of some proficiency and then I just stopped.

With all the technology I'll need to learn in the future for Data Engineering, I cannot go that route of stopping short of the goal line.  I need to smash the goal-line and make it my B-word.  Respectfully of course.  Just typing these thoughts out are helping.  So, I need a plan of attack and a plan to keep me accountable.  But!  I don't want to fall into the trap of preparing to prepare to get ready to start a thing and have it take me forever.  So I think a balance of a quarter of time planning and three quarters of a time getting my brain dirty and just doing it.  As Nike would say.

Well, it has been 15 minutes so I am going to review some tagged flash cards and make a new note page for those questions.  My goal is to do 10 questions in 45 mins. BRB.

IDEA: Come up with my own lab(kata) of:
* configuring network connections from scratch
* pretty much check out the labs from LinuxAcademy and expand on those
